# VirtualWorldInternet

This project aims to visualize the "virtual world" in novels through the combination of 3D rendering and web crawling. It is currently under development.

## Description

The VirtualWorldInternet project is a 3D rendering and web crawling project that aims to visualize the "virtual world" in novels. It uses 3D rendering technology to create a 3D environment that represents the virtual world, and uses web crawling technology to collect and analyze information about the virtual world from the Internet.

## Features

- 3D rendering: The project uses 3D rendering technology to create a 3D environment that represents the virtual world. This allows users to explore and interact with the virtual world in a more realistic and immersive way.
- Web crawling: The project uses web crawling technology to collect and analyze information about the virtual world from the Internet. This allows the project to keep up-to-date with the latest information about the virtual world and provide users with more accurate and detailed information.
- Combination of 3D rendering and web crawling: The project combines the advantages of 3D rendering and web crawling, allowing users to explore and interact with the virtual world in a more realistic and immersive way, while also providing them with accurate and detailed information about the virtual world.

## Requirements

- 3D rendering engine: The project requires a 3D rendering engine to create the 3D environment. Some popular 3D rendering engines include Unity, Unreal Engine, and Blender.
- Web crawling library: The project requires a web crawling library to collect and analyze information about the virtual world from the Internet. Some popular web crawling libraries include Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, and Requests.
- Programming language: The project requires a programming language to write the code for the 3D rendering and web crawling components. Some popular programming languages include Python, JavaScript, and C++.

## Development progress

The VirtualWorldInternet project is currently under development. The project has completed the following tasks:

1. Set up the 3D rendering environment using Unity.
2. Set up the web crawling environment using Scrapy.
3. Collected information about the virtual world from the Internet using web crawling.
4. Analyzed the collected information and created a 3D model of the virtual world.

The project is currently working on the following tasks:

1. Optimize the 3D rendering performance.
2. Add more features to the 3D environment, such as interactive objects and characters.
3. Integrate the 3D environment with the web crawling component to provide users with more accurate and detailed information about the virtual world.

## Future plans

The VirtualWorldInternet project has the following future plans:

1. Complete the development of the 3D rendering and web crawling components.
2. Launch the virtual world for users to explore and interact with.
3. Provide users with more accurate and detailed information about the virtual world.
4. Continue to optimize the 3D rendering performance and add more features to the 3D environment.
